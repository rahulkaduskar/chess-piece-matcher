#### Provided an IPv4 address, say 8.8.8.8, use a RESTful client to get the result from ipinfo.io (e.g. http://ipinfo.io/8.8.8.8) and take the altitude geocoordinate, casting it to an integer N. Then, use N to construct an N x N chess board. Randomly assign N/2 unique coordinates on which a Queen will sit. No other pieces will be on the board. Your program should then determine if all of the queens are placed in such a way where none of them are attacking each other. 
If this is true for the given inputs, return the string true, otherwise return each pair of attacking Queens.
